In general, the cost of an installment loan comprises the interest, fees, payments for credit insurance premiums and other ancillary products, and interest charged for financed premiums. However, under the TILA, stated APRs do not include all of these costs.19 The more accurate representation is the all-in APR, which captures all costs associated with the loan, including those for credit insurance and other ancillary products, and is the rate a borrower actually pays based on how much cash they received and how much they owe.20

Among the loan contracts Pew analyzed, the highest all-in APR was 367 percent on a $129 loan and the lowest was 16 percent on $10,000. The average was 90 percent for small loans and 40 percent for large ones. Although APRs decreased as loans got larger, the dollar cost as a share of the loan proceeds increased. Average costs were 45 percent of loan proceeds for small loans and 65 percent for large loans.
